                <h3>CLIMA : Climate Change Awareness and Tracking</h3>
                <p>Clima is an innovative web project designed to raise awareness about climate change and track the recorded data of climatic gases. The main feature of Clima is its interactive timeline that illustrates the changes in climate over the years. Users can explore how various climatic gases have evolved and impacted our environment. The website includes an "About" tab, providing detailed information on climate change and its global effects. The primary goal of Clima is to educate and inform users about the critical issues related to climate change.

                    Developed using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, Clima offers a sleek and user-friendly interface. While the frontend of the project is fully developed, showcasing a visually appealing design and intuitive navigation, the backend is still under development to ensure robust data handling and integration. Additionally, Clima utilizes the Google API to enhance its functionality and provide accurate, real-time data.
                    
                    As the project progresses, Clima aims to become a comprehensive platform for climate change awareness, empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions for a sustainable future. One unique feature of Clima is the integration of a chatbot named Clima7.0, which is designed to share information and answer questions about climate change. This chatbot offers an interactive experience, allowing users to engage in real-time conversations about environmental issues and gain insights into the effects of climate change.
                    
                    Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and refine this important tool. Clima is committed to making a positive impact by raising awareness and encouraging proactive steps toward sustainability.</p>
